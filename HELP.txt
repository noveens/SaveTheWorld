###########################################################

- The motive of the game is to collect as many grey and black falling blocks and destroying the
  dangerous (red) blocks.

- The blocks spawn from the top at random positions every second. The blocks
  can be good blocks (black and grey) or dangerous blocks(red).

- Dangerous Blocks: The blocks coloured red are dangerous blocks.
  Good Blocks: The blocks coloured black or grey are the good blocks.

- The game also has a lazer that can be used to shoot down the dangerous blocks,
  but a penalty will NOT be imposed if the good blocks are destroyed.

- There are mirrors in the game that can reflect the lazer shot from the blue-side of it,
  following normal reflection laws.
 
- You can only shoot until the battery has some charge present. After that you have to leave
  shooting button to let battery recharge.

- Walls in the game simply absorb the lazer.
 
- There are two buckets coloured black and grey at the bottom of the screen which can be moved 
  horizontally to collect the similarly coloured falling bricks. Penalty will NOT be imposed
  if wrong color blocks, except red blocks are collected in wrong buckets.
  
- The blocks not collected by any bucket or destroyed by lazer will simply fall.

- The game will never get over, so sit back and enjoy :D

- Hope you like it.
